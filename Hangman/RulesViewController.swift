            An app thinks of a word. The Player try to guess what it is one letter at a time.
            The app draws a number of  "?" equivalent to the number of letters in the word. If a player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the app fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places. If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the app draws one element of a hangmanâ€™s gallows. As the game progresses, a segment of the gallows and of a victim is added for every suggested letter not in the word. The number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is seven. Good luck.
